## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene from the perspective of a rubber tapper in the longhouse, observing the Pereiras' final days on the plantation.
- Draft a letter from Elias's cousin in Perth, describing the 'promised land' of Australia with a mixture of hope and hollow salesmanship.
- Create a monologue for Mr. Tan, explaining his philosophy of business and debt to a junior associate, using the Pereira case as an example.
- Imagine a chapter where Julian, years later, returns to the now-reclaimed plantation site and has a confrontation with a descendant of one of the tappers.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map tracing the journey of the crate from its origin to the godown, annotating each node with historical and economic context of the trade.
- Create a 'Decay Simulator' that visually represents the spread of the fungal blight (Phytophthora) across a plantation grid, tied to narrative choices made by the characters.
